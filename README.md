# Automatic_License_Plate_Detection

Automatic License Plate Detection
Overview
Automatic License Plate Detection is a project aimed at identifying and reading license plates from images or video streams using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. This project is built on the robust YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and deployed using Streamlit for ease of use and accessibility. Applications of this project include traffic monitoring, automated toll collection, and parking management systems.

Features
Real-time License Plate Detection: Accurate detection and reading of license plates in images or video streams.
Image Preprocessing: Extensive processing of XML files converted into YOLO format for better model training.
Trained YOLOv5 Model: Efficient detection model trained for 100 epochs.
High Accuracy: Achieved mAP@0.5-0.7 and mAP@5_0.95-0.5, ensuring reliable detection performance.
User-Friendly Deployment: Deployed using Streamlit for easy access and interaction.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language used for the project.
PyTorch: For building and training the neural network models.
YOLO: Advanced object detection framework used for detecting license plates.
Streamlit: For deploying the model and creating an interactive web interface.
Computer Vision: Techniques and tools for image processing and analysis.
Dataset
433 Pre-Annotated Images: Comprehensive dataset of annotated images.
Extensive XML Processing: Conversion of annotations into YOLO format for effective training.
