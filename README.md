**Automatic License Plate Detection**
Overview
Automatic License Plate Detection is a project designed to identify and read license plates from images or video streams using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. This project employs computer vision techniques and is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

Features
Real-time Detection: Accurate and efficient license plate detection.
Model Training: YOLOv5 model trained for 100 epochs on a dataset of 433 pre-annotated images.
High Accuracy: Achieved mAP@0.5-0.7 and mAP@5_0.95-0.5.
Deployment: User-friendly web interface using Streamlit.
